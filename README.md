# MMC5277: Assignment 6
## Re-Create a Portfolio Website Using CSS Flexbox

This assignment is a continuation of Assignment 5 ([repo](https://github.com/zacharywilkerson/m5-hw5-wilkerson-zachary), [live](https://zacharywilkerson.github.io/m5-hw5-wilkerson-zachary/)), where I had previously designed a portfolio website using CSS float layouts. 

In this assignment, I incorperated CSS Flexbox into my website to achieve better structure and alignment of elements.

My site for Assignment 6 ([live](https://zacharywilkerson.github.io/m6-hw6-wilkerson-zachary/)) is available through Github Pages. Feel free to have a look (preview below)!
